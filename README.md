ðŸ¦† Ducks all the way down
=======

This is a convenience package for everyone who has a deep and abiding love affair with SQL (and ducks).

Instead of using other incredibly popular and useful packages like [data.table](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/) or [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), one could use `duckdf` instead to slice and dice dataframes with SQL. Precedence exists in the [sqldf](https://github.com/ggrothendieck/sqldf) package, but this one is better because it quacks.

It's also meant to be a bit of fun.

## Quick Start

To install this package, first install [duckdb](https://duckdb.org/):

```r
install.packages("duckdb")
```
This package has been tested against the 0.2.4 version of `duckdb`

Then install `duckdf` with the `remotes` package.

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
library("remotes")
remotes::install_github("phillc73/duckdf")
library("duckdf")
```

## Usage

If you want to write "normal" SQL SELECT statements in an R function, against an existing dataframe:

```r
duckdf("SELECT mpg, cyl FROM mtcars WHERE disp >= 200")
```

This registers the well known `mtcars` dataset as a virtual table in the `duckdb` database, then selects just the columns `mpg` and `cyl`, where the `disp` column is greater than 200.

In reality, this function is just a simple wrapper around a collection of `DBI` functions, such as `dbConnect()`, `dbGetQuery()`, `dbDisconnect()` and the `duckdb` function `duckdb_register`.

If you want to fly as fast as possible, the same query may be executed, but with the dataframe specifically named:

```r
duckdf("SELECT mpg, cyl FROM mtcars WHERE disp >= 200", 
      df_name = "mtcars")
 ```
Defining a specific dataframe name in this way is slightly faster than allowing `duckdf()` to figure it out by making a decision based on the query string alone. As `duckdf()` uses string processing to decide the dataframe name to use when one is not defined, it is probably also more robust to do define one, although perhaps not as convenient.

Multiple dataframes may be named, to support joins:

```r
  duckdf(
"SELECT origin, dest,
    COUNT(flight) AS num_flts,
    round(SUM(seats)) AS num_seats,
    round(AVG(arr_delay)) AS avg_delay
  FROM flights f LEFT OUTER JOIN planes p
    ON f.tailnum = p.tailnum
  WHERE distance BETWEEN 200 AND 300
    AND air_time IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY origin, dest
  HAVING COUNT(flight) > 3000
  ORDER BY num_seats DESC, avg_delay ASC
  LIMIT 2;",
  df_name = c("flights", "planes")
        )
```

Joins of up to only two dataframes are supported where no specific dataframes are defined. See the `nycflights13` benchmark example below for such an SQL query.

```r
duckdf("SELECT mpg, cyl FROM mtcars WHERE disp >= 200",
      persist = TRUE)
```
The above is obviously the same SQL statement, however by using `persist = TRUE` an on-disk `duckdb` database is created in the current working directory. The name of the database will be the same as the first named dataframe. 

The function `duckdf::persist()` may also be used directly.

```r
duckdf::persist("SELECT mpg, cyl FROM mtcars WHERE disp >= 200")
```

It is also possible to define a specific on-disk database name, different from the dataframe name used in the query. 

```r
duckdf("SELECT mpg, cyl FROM mtcars WHERE disp >= 200",
      persist = TRUE,
      db_name = "mt_cars")
```

If you've already created a DuckDB database, or received one from the flock, it is possible to return some brief information about each table it contains. Assuming the database on disk is named `mtcars`

```r
duckdf::gander("mtcars")
```

IF the database is found in the current working directory, this returns a list of the first five rows from each table. Each list item name corresponds with the database table name. Databases with up to two tables are currently supported.

```r
duckdf::gander("mtcars", show_types = TRUE)
```
This returns a named list as well, but the table column types are now shown.

This following function simply removes all traces of the `duckdb` called `mtcars` from the current working directory.

```r
duckdf::cleanup("mtcars")
```

This package also supports DuckDB's CSV reader. In the spirit of R packages using obscure verbs to describe functions, in this package we have `duckdf::ingest()`

```r
duckdf::ingest(name = "descriptive_name", 
              file = "filename.csv", 
              persist = TRUE)
```
The above will ingest the file called `filename.csv`, if found in the current working directory, into a `duckdb` database named, `descriptive_name`, and save it to disk. The single table in the database will also be called `descriptive_name`. This data can then be queried with `duckdf(query, persist = TRUE)` or `duckdf_persist()`. 

If `persist = FALSE`, only a dataframe in the global environment is created, via a `duckdb` virtual table intermediate, and then `duckdf()` may be used to query it directly.

It is also possible to define the returned object as either a `data.table` or `tibble`. The default returned object is a `data.frame`.

```r
duckdf::ingest(name = "descriptive_name", 
              file = "filename.csv", 
              persist = FALSE,
              object_type = "data.table")
```

## Benchmarks

Is this package any good? If some measure of good is the speed at which results are returned, then this package is reasonably good.

The benchmarks below are generated on a laptiop with an i7-8565U CPU. If you try these numbers yourself, the results will differ but the general themes should remain the same.

The current `duckdf` SELECT functions have been vaguely tested against other popular approaches including `data.table`, `dplyr`, `dbplyr`, `tidyquery` and `sqldf`.

Coinsidering only simple queries, `duckdf()` is significantly faster than `sqldf` and `tidyquery`, somewhat faster than the current implementation of `dbplyr`, not quite as fast as `dplyr` and much, much slower than `data.table`. In fact, if you'd like to query a `data.table` more slowly, `duckdf` can support that too.

`duckdf_persist()` is slow because it writes or reads a `duckdf` database to disk on each iteration.

    copy_to(con, mtcars, "mtcars_dbplyr", temporary = FALSE)

    mtcars_db <- tbl(con, "mtcars_dbplyr")

    DBI::dbDisconnect(con, shutdown = TRUE)

    mtcars_result <- mtcars_db %>%
    dplyr::filter(disp >= 200) %>%
    dplyr::select(mpg,cyl)

    return(mtcars_result)

}

But wait, there's more. A more complex query benchmark, this time compared to `tidyquery` using the SQL example from their [README page](https://github.com/ianmcook/tidyquery), and the `dplyr` equivalent generated through the `tidyquery` `show_dplyr()` function. The result is different and the `duckdb` and `duckdf` combination appear to be quickest.

Of course there are lies, damn lies and benchmarks. Different datasets, of different size or different column types, using different queries, may produce entirely different results.

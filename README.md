ðŸ¦† Ducks all the way down
=======

This is a convenience package for everyone who has a deep and abiding love affair with SQL (and ducks).

Instead of using other incredibly popular and useful packages like [data.table](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/) or [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), one could use `duckdf` instead to slice and dice dataframes with SQL. Precedence exists in the [sqldf](https://github.com/ggrothendieck/sqldf) package, but this one is better because it quacks (although is not nearly as comprehensive, well planned or tested).

It's also meant to be a bit of fun.

## Quick Start

To install this package, first install [duckdb](https://duckdb.org/):

```r
install.packages("duckdb")
```
This package has been tested against the 0.2.4 version of `duckdb`

Then install `duckdf` with the `remotes` package.

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
library("remotes")
remotes::install_github("phillc73/duckdf")
library("duckdf")
```

## Usage

If you want to write "normal" SQL SELECT statements in an R function, against an existing dataframe:

```r
duckdf("SELECT mpg, cyl FROM mtcars WHERE disp >= 200")
```

This registers the well known `mtcars` dataset as a virtual table in the `duckdb` database, then selects just the columns `mpg` and `cyl`, where the `disp` column is greater than 200.

In reality, this function is just a simple wrapper around a collection of `DBI` functions, such as `dbConnect()`, `dbGetQuery()`, `dbDisconnect()` and the `duckdb` function `duckdb_register`.

```r
duckdf_persist("SELECT mpg, cyl FROM mtcars WHERE disp >= 200")
```
The above is obviously the same SQL statement, however by using `duckdf_persist()` an on-disk `duckdb` database is created in the current working directory. 

```r
duckdf_cleanup("mtcars")
```
This simply removes all traces of the `duckdb` called `mtcars` from the current working directory.

## Benchmarks

Is this package any good? If some measure of good is the speed at which results are returned, then this package is reasonably good.

The benchmarks below are generated on a laptiop with an i7-8565U CPU. If you try these numbers yourself, the results will differ but the general themes should remain the same.

The current `duckdf` SELECT functions have been vaguely tested against other popular approaches including `data.table`, `dplyr`, `dbplyr`, `tidyquery` and `sqldf`.

`duckdf()` is significantly faster than `sqldf` and `tidyquery`, somewhat faster than the current implementation of `dbplyr`, not quite as fast as `dplyr` and much, much slower than `data.table`. In fact, if you'd like to query a `data.table` more slowly, `duckdf` can support that too.

`duckdf_persist()` is slow because it writes and then reads a `duckdf` database to disk on each iteration.

```r
library(duckdb)
library(duckdf)
library(dplyr)
library(dbplyr)
library(microbenchmark)
library(sqldf)
library(data.table)
library(tidyquery)
library(ggplot2)

# Make a data.table
mtcars_data_table <- data.table(mtcars)

# dbplyr test function
dbplyr_test <- function() {
    con <- dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb(), ":memory:")

    copy_to(con, mtcars, "mtcars_dbplyr", temporary = FALSE)

    mtcars_db <- tbl(con, "mtcars_dbplyr")

    DBI::dbDisconnect(con, shutdown = TRUE)

    mtcars_result <- mtcars_db %>%
    dplyr::filter(disp >= 200) %>%
    dplyr::select(mpg,cyl)

    return(mtcars_result)

}

# Run the benchmark as often as you like
duck_bench <- microbenchmark(times=500,
                             # sqldf library
                             sqldf("SELECT mpg, cyl FROM mtcars WHERE disp >= 200"),
                             # tidyquery library
                             query("SELECT mpg, cyl FROM mtcars WHERE disp >= 200"),
                             # duckdf library
                             duckdf("SELECT mpg, cyl FROM mtcars WHERE disp >= 200"),
                             duckdf_persist("SELECT mpg, cyl FROM mtcars WHERE disp >= 200"),
                             # data.table library
                             mtcars_data_table[disp >= 200, c("mpg", "cyl"),],
                             # dplyr library
                             mtcars %>%
                               dplyr::filter(disp >= 200) %>%
                               dplyr::select(mpg,cyl),
                             # dbplyr library
                             dbplyr_test()
                            )

autoplot(duck_bench)
```

Of course there are lies, damn lies and benchmarks. Different datasets, of different size or different column types, may produce entirely different results.
